The sentiment analysis service will also break the opinion down to detect exactly which features or attributes or elements of the subject are being discussed. For a product this could be the main components or accessories as for example, the “screen“ in “the screen of the Galaxy Tab” or the “case“ in “my new iPad case“.

Running in the cloud, it can be integrated with your data and various external web applications and provide significantly lower IT costs and eliminate time maintaining, scaling and updating software and servers.
